# Security-Robot-Using-Turtlebot3
An autonomous security patrol robot simulation using TurtleBot3, ROS Noetic, and Gazebo. The robot performs automated patrols and detects door status (open/closed) using yaw orientation in a simulated office environment.

## 📦 Features
- ✅ **Autonomous multi-point patrol** around office environment.
- 🚪 **Door status detection** using yaw orientation via `/gazebo/get_model_state`.
- 🧠 Optional **image-based door detection** using OpenCV.
- 📍 Integrated with **SLAM** and **navigation stack** (`move_base`, RViz).
- 🧪 Fully tested in simulation (no physical hardware required).

- ## 🧰 Requirements

- Ubuntu 20.04
- ROS Noetic
- TurtleBot3 packages
- Gazebo (default with ROS Noetic)
- OpenCV (for image detection)
- RViz
