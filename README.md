# Security-Robot-Using-Turtlebot3
An autonomous security patrol robot simulation using TurtleBot3, ROS Noetic, and Gazebo. The robot performs automated patrols and detects door status (open/closed) using yaw orientation in a simulated office environment.


## 🛡️ Overview
This project simulates a security robot in an office environment using TurtleBot3 (Waffle Pi), ROS Noetic, and Gazebo. The robot performs automatic patrols and checks the status of doors based on their yaw orientation to detect unauthorized entry.

## 📁 Features
- Multi-point autonomous patrol
- Door status detection based on yaw orientation (open/closed)
- Optional image-based detection using OpenCV (experimental)
- ROS + Gazebo simulation only (no real hardware required)

## 🚀 Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/security-robot-turtlebot3.git
